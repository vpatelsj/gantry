# Gantry deployment artifacts

This directory carries the operator-facing pieces needed to roll out
the gantry agent as a Kubernetes DaemonSet.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-arch, distroless build (§Phase 6). |
| `build.sh` | Local image build helper. Tags from `git describe`. |
| `daemonset.yaml` | One-pod-per-node DaemonSet (§Phase 6 / §7.5). |
| `serviceaccount.yaml` | ServiceAccount + ClusterRole + Role + PriorityClass. |
| `configmap.yaml` | Default `config.yaml` (mirrors `config.NewDefault()`). |
| `registry-secret.example.yaml` | Template Secret for upstream-registry credentials. |
| `examples/networkpolicy.yaml` | **Hardening overlay (NOT applied by default).** See [Hardening overlays](#hardening-overlays) below. |
| `hosts.toml.template` | containerd registry mirror config; one file per upstream registry under `/etc/containerd/certs.d/<host>/hosts.toml`. |

## Apply order

```sh
kubectl apply -f deploy/serviceaccount.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/configmap.yaml
# Operator: for any PRIVATE upstream registry, edit
# registry-secret.example.yaml (rename it, fill in real
# username:password values keyed by registry `name:`) and apply,
# AND uncomment the matching `credentials_path:` line in
# configmap.yaml. The default ConfigMap ships credentials-free so
# the agent starts cleanly against public registries without any
# Secret being applied — origin.New eagerly reads every
# credentials_path at startup, so an unmatched path would
# crashloop the pod.
kubectl apply -f deploy/registry-secret.example.yaml   # private registries only
kubectl apply -f deploy/daemonset.yaml
# deploy/examples/networkpolicy.yaml is a hardening overlay; do NOT
# apply it as part of the initial install. See "Hardening overlays"
# below for the workflow.
```

## Building the image locally

```sh
# Single-arch into local docker (host arch):
deploy/build.sh

# Multi-arch + push:
deploy/build.sh -p linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -r ghcr.io/your-org/gantry --push

# Explicit tag:
deploy/build.sh -t v0.6.0
```

## Per-node containerd setup

For each upstream registry the cluster pulls from, drop a
`hosts.toml` at:

```
/etc/containerd/certs.d/<registry-host>/hosts.toml
```

derived from `hosts.toml.template` (substitute `${REGISTRY_SERVER}`
with the registry's `https://...` URL). containerd reloads `certs.d`
on its own; no restart needed.

## What to verify after rollout

| Check | How |
| --- | --- |
| Agents are running | `kubectl -n gantry-system get ds gantry` |
| Liveness / readiness | `/livez`, `/readyz` on 9095 per pod |
| Metrics | `curl http://<pod-ip>:9095/metrics` or scrape from Prometheus |
| Routing-table grew | `p2p_dht_health_score` ≥ 0.7 |
| Mirror is being used | `p2p_cache_hit_total` increments while a workload rolls out |
| Origin fallback is rare | `p2p_origin_fallback_total` stays at ~0 |

See `docs/detailed-design.md` §7.6 for the full metric catalogue.

## Hardening overlays

`deploy/examples/` carries optional hardening manifests that are
intentionally **not** part of the default `kubectl apply` workflow.
Every overlay there contains at least one site-specific value (CIDR,
endpoint, label) that no shipped manifest can guess correctly across
arbitrary clusters, so applying them unedited will fail the cluster
into a state that is hard to debug.

> **Production guidance:** the default install leaves the mirror
> listener (5000) and transfer listener (5001) reachable from other
> pods on the cluster network at `<podIP>:port`. The `hostIP:
> 127.0.0.1` binding on the DaemonSet's hostPort only restricts
> *host-side* reach; the listener inside the pod is still
> `0.0.0.0`. Production installs **should** adopt
> [`examples/networkpolicy.yaml`](examples/networkpolicy.yaml) (or
> an equivalent NetworkPolicy in their own overlay) to close that
> pod-network gap. The overlay is shipped as an example rather than
> a default because its allow-list depends on the cluster's
> node-CIDR range, which is site-specific (see the workflow below).

### `examples/networkpolicy.yaml`

Locks transfer (5001), libp2p (4001), mirror (5000), and metrics
(9095) to the minimum traffic each port needs. Holds the manifest
shape required by §7.5 but **defers four CIDR choices to the
operator** — apiserver endpoint, kubelet probe source, mirror DNAT
source, registry egress. See the long "OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED"
block at the top of the file and the [Production caveats](#production-caveats)
table below.

Workflow:

1. Roll out the DaemonSet without the overlay and verify
   `kubectl -n gantry-system rollout status ds/gantry`,
   `p2p_cache_hit_total`, and a successful workload pull.
2. Copy the overlay into your own repository (or a Kustomize /
   Helm chart), edit every ipBlock marked "OPERATOR ACTION
   REQUIRED", and review against your CNI's hostPort SNAT
   behaviour (`kubectl get nodes -o yaml | grep -A2 podCIDR`,
   etc.).
3. Apply with `kubectl apply -f your-overlay/networkpolicy.yaml`.
   Watch `/readyz` and any in-flight mirror pulls for at least one
   full image pull cycle — a wrong CIDR will surface as
   `dht routing table empty` (no peer libp2p traffic) or as
   containerd `connection refused` on 5000 (wrong mirror source
   CIDR), not as a NetworkPolicy validation error.
4. Roll back with `kubectl delete networkpolicy -n gantry-system
   gantry-agent` if anything regresses.

Future hardening overlays (Pod Security Standards, dedicated
PriorityClass, alternative `hostNetwork: true` topology) will live
in the same directory and follow the same "deferred to operator,
not in default install" rule.

## Production caveats

A few configuration knobs that need operator attention before going
to production:

| Item | Where | What to change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API server egress CIDR | `examples/networkpolicy.yaml` | The egress to TCP/443 and TCP/6443 defaults to `0.0.0.0/0` because managed control planes (EKS / GKE / AKS) and self-hosted clusters reach the apiserver at IPs that don't match a `namespaceSelector`. Replace with the apiserver's actual CIDR — `kubectl get endpoints kubernetes -n default -o jsonpath='{.subsets[*].addresses[*].ip}'` for self-hosted clusters; the managed-service docs for hosted control planes. |
| Origin registry egress | `examples/networkpolicy.yaml` | The egress to TCP/443 for origin pulls also defaults to `0.0.0.0/0`. If the cluster only pulls from a known set of registry endpoints (your private registry, ghcr.io, etc.), restrict this rule to those IPs or labels. |
| Kubelet probe source | `examples/networkpolicy.yaml` | Metrics ingress on TCP/9095 currently allows `0.0.0.0/0` so kubelet liveness/readiness probes (sourced from the node IP) reach the pod on strict CNIs. Replace with the node CIDR — `kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}'`. |
| Mirror port 5000 source | `examples/networkpolicy.yaml` | Ingress on TCP/5000 defaults to a deliberately-narrow `127.0.0.1/32` placeholder. Most CNIs (Calico, Cilium, and managed offerings) SNAT hostPort traffic so the in-pod source-IP after DNAT is the node IP, NOT 127.0.0.1 — the placeholder will then drop containerd's mirror pulls. Replace with the node CIDR (same command as the kubelet probe row). MUST NOT widen to the pod-network CIDR: that bypasses the `hostIP: 127.0.0.1` binding's loopback-only intent. |
| containerd socket access | `daemonset.yaml` | The pod runs as non-root (UID 65532); `containerd.sock` is typically root:root mode 0660. Set `spec.template.spec.securityContext.fsGroup` to a group with socket access, relax socket perms on the node, or clear `containerd_socket` in the ConfigMap to disable cdsub. |
| Kubernetes RBAC scope | `serviceaccount.yaml` | The agent only consumes `pods.list/watch` (informer) plus `pods.patch` (self-announce of libp2p + transfer addresses) in its own namespace, and `nodes.list/watch` cluster-wide for the zone label. There is no `get` on pods — informer events deliver the objects without point reads. Review `ClusterRole/Role` to confirm scope hasn't drifted. Membership setup failure is fatal in production mode (Downward-API env vars set), so an RBAC misconfig surfaces as a CrashLoop on rollout instead of a silent single-node fallback. |

### HEAD semantics on cache miss

`GET /v2/<repo>/blobs/<digest>` on a cache miss warms the cache as a
side effect; `HEAD` on the same URL does NOT. This is intentional
(see the comment block in `internal/mirror/mirror.go` at the HEAD
return after `writeBlobHeaders`) — caching a multi-GB blob just
because a client asked for its size would defeat the bandwidth
amplification fix Gantry exists to provide. A subsequent GET for
the same digest follows the cache-miss path normally and warms
the cache then.

If your client emits HEAD-then-GET patterns where you'd prefer to
amortize the origin metadata round-trip, raise the issue upstream
(containerd's puller, BuildKit's resolver, etc.) — those clients
generally have a one-shot resolve-and-pull mode that skips the
HEAD entirely.
