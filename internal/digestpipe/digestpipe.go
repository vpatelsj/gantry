// Package digestpipe is the digest-verifying stream tee.
//
// A Writer wraps an underlying io.Writer (typically a *os.File or an
// io.MultiWriter that fans out to disk + a peer response) and computes
// a sha256 digest incrementally as bytes flow through. After the stream
// ends the caller invokes Verify(d) to check that the computed digest
// matches an expected value.
//
// The original §6.2 design called for a "digest-verifying stream tee
// (containerd ↔ peer ↔ cache)". This package is the primitive on which
// internal/cache.Writer is built; it can also be composed directly by
// callers that already own the destination io.Writer (peer transfer,
// HTTP response). The tee itself is just bytes-through; Verify is the
// authoritative go/no-go.
